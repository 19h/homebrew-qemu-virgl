# 3D accelerated qemu on MacOS

![ubuntu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6728841/111193747-90da1a00-85cb-11eb-9517-36c1a19c19be.gif)

## What is it for

If you own a Mac (x86 or ARM) and want to have a full Linux desktop for development or testing, you'll find that having a responsive desktop is a nice thing. The graphical acceleration is possible thanks to [the work](https://gist.github.com/akihikodaki/87df4149e7ca87f18dc56807ec5a1bc5) of [Akihiko Odaki](https://github.com/akihikodaki). I've only packaged it into an easily-installable brew repository while the changes are not yet merged into upstream.

Features:

- Support for both ARM and X86 acceleration with Hypervisor.framework (works without root or kernel extensions)
- Support for OpenGL acceleration in the guest (both X11 and Wayland)
- Works on large screens (5k+)
- Dynamically changing guest resolution on window resize
- Properly handle sound output when plugging/unplugging headphones

## Installation

`brew install knazarov/qemu-virgl/qemu-virgl`

Or `brew tap knazarov/qemu-virgl` and then `brew install qemu-virgl`.
